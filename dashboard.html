                                just a bonus) *note, I chose to aggregate the
                                data by Name because some video game titles can
                                be the same put exist on different platforms and
                                I figured it was best to aggregate sales by the

                                complicated, requiring you to configure a bunch
                                of stuff before the graph can be seen. It seems
                                like for simple visualizations, processing data
                                in python and using matplotlib might be an

                                the baseline from 0 to some other number and
                                subsequently change the scale of the graph, a
                                graph might look like it is displaying a large

                                the difference is slight. To avoid falling into
                                this trap, always set the baseline to 0 or if
                                you want to highlight the differences, makes
                                sure to mention that the graph might not start
                                at 0 and call attention to the scaling of the
                                graph.

                                show some trend contrary to the actual data
                                trend if the entire data range was shown. Make
                                sure when you are displaying the data, let
                                people know when these data points were taken

                                provides a clear and sensible range.
